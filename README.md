# Saving-user-info-with-Amazon-Lex-chatbot
This project leverages Amazon Lex to create a chatbot capable of saving and utilizing user information through context tags. By enabling context-aware conversations, the chatbot provides a seamless user experience by remembering details, such as the user's date of birth, for follow-up queries without requiring repetitive input.
